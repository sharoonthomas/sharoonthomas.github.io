I created this blog in 2006, when I thought I should start scribbling my
thoughts somewhere....
But it took me this Jan of 2009 to draft this first blog.
(I hope it just does make it out of the drafts)

If my concern in 2006 was 'What to blog?', today it has become
'Why should another day go undocumented? I have the rights too..

I believe this blog will help me talk to myself.... if you happen to
accidentally overhear them (as I don't plan on disclosing this blog to anybody)
its all about My dreams, thoughts and the very few of them which transform
into action.

My interests on date seem to be computing, programming and nothing.
May be I can scribble my little know how of computing too...

Isn't this enough blogging for day 1? I guess yes!
