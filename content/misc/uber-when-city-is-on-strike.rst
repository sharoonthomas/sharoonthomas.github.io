So what do you do when you end up in a city and is welcomed by the All
India strike ? Use Uber! That's exactly what I ended up doing yesterday.

Here's my story of moving around in the city of Bangalore yesterday.

As soon as I got out of the long distance bus that got me to Bangalore, me
and fellow passengers were surrounded by Auto Rikshaw drivers. Even before
I could detail my destination, I was given the estimated Rs. 400 (but the
driver did not have the slightest clue of my destination). I decided to
try Uber and after a short wait of 7 minutes my car came to exactly where
I stood. Yay and guess how much it cost me ? Rs. 95, less than a fourth of
what the auto rikshaw driver was asking for.

I know what you are thinking, it's all about bargaining isn't it ? Indeed
it is, but that is precisely what I dislike spending my time on and perhaps
even spoiling my mood on.

Throughout the day, I made another three trips. All of them would have
cost me way more than what Uber charged me and each of them would have
involved bargaining with multiple auto rikshaw drivers (if I could find
one that was not part of the strike). And, I also get a receipt for each
trip which I could then expense.

Dear Uber, thank you for coming to India and I look forward to using you
more in India, but here is what sucks - Payment. I realize it is the archaic
regulation by RBI, but being able to pay by credit card would have been far
more convenient.
