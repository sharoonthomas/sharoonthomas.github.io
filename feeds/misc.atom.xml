thoughts somewhere....
But it took me this Jan of 2009 to draft this first blog.
(I hope it just does make it out of the drafts)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my concern in 2006 was 'What to blog?', today it has become
'Why should another day go undocumented? I have the rights too..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this blog will help me talk to myself.... if you happen to
accidentally overhear them (as I don't plan on disclosing this blog to anybody)
its all about My dreams, thoughts and the very few of them which transform
into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interests on date seem to be computing, programming and nothing.
May be I can scribble my little know how of computing too...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't this enough blogging for day 1? I guess yes!&lt;/p&gt;
